This project is a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built using:
- Ollama (to run open-source LLMs like `llama3`)
- LangChain (to build the conversational agent)
- ChromaDB (as the local vector database)

It is specifically designed to answer questions only about the company AvaniMudra (AM) using scraped company documentation.
