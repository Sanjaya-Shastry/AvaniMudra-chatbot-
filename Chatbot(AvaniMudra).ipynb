      "The site was a narrow corner plot, deep inset in the locality of Nagarabavi, dotted by huge trees. A trapezoidal plot measuring 6’ on one side and 22 ‘ on the other side with an elaborate brief to create a modern looking dental prosthetic clinic that needs to become a landmark by its architectural expression  was a real challenge.\n",
      "The corner where the road meets was an acute angle, from where you had a long visibility and the huge tree canopies gave the initial impetus to the design development. The Edges where softened so that we reduce on the rigid vertical lines on the façade, so that the building appears to be bigger. The glazed façade on the road side ensured enough light and ventilation. At the upper levels extensive use of glass helped in establishing the connection with tree canopies giving a feel of tree house.\n",
      "A low plinth with the seamless connection to the ground one enters on to reception and waiting lounge which is kept open, giving the feel of open pavilion. A toilet and vertical circulation core is placed on the narrow edge of the plot. In the first and second floor we have a large hall which has a dental chair, working desk along with the lounge seating and consultation areas. The large deck overlooks the surrounding green gives that additional expanse from inside out along with a nice layering to the façade from outside. The last floor accommodates the back of the house facilities including X-ray console, pantry and other areas\n",
      "In terms of the materials, a monochromatic palette across the building was used, so that it looks cohesive without any fragmentation. The interior also has got a micro concrete floor matching the wall and ceiling with the accents of wood. A filleted corner, with arched openings and curved false ceiling makes the defining lines invisible makes the interior seamless.\n",

      "Dr Ritu\n",
      "Transforming a small, skewed site into a luxurious, open space wasn’t easy, and we hadn’t imagined it could turn into something so beautiful. The way the outdoors seamlessly blends with the indoors brings out the true charm of our clinic. The lush greenery surrounding the space, combined with the thoughtfully designed landscape on each floor, makes it an absolute delight to experience.\n",
      "Architect Vijay and Rajni always approached the project with openness, truly listening to our inputs. There was always space for fresh ideas to take shape, making the entire process dynamic and engaging. As aesthetic enthusiasts, my husband and I loved working with Avani Mudra’s team. We absolutely love the facade they designed, which ties everything together beautifully.\n",

      "A 5 bedroom bungalow with an elaborate brief resulted in vertical stack up across 4 levels. The challenge was to articulate the mass, so that it doesn’t look like simple extrusion. The punctuation and layering is done in such a way that it will look lighter and visually appealing.\n",

At this level two bedrooms with large deck space keeps the residents engaged with an outdoor gazebo, complete with a barbeque grill.\n",

This allowed the level of rain protection and security without compromising the visual aspect. The clean soffit of the roof with inverted beams acted as built in planter box with plants falling down creating a secondary skin of green foliage.\n",

The idea was to create the built form along the road with the enclosed void within, where the entire house opens on to and also becomes the focal point. This was the need of a project for a couple who were   well-travelled, socially active with large friend circle.  The idea was to create an agile, private open space within a built form, which can be modulated and appropriated based on the occasion accommodating varied user group from a small group of friends to a large gathering.\n",
      "The U prototype  single bay plan spread across two floors,  accommodating 4 bed rooms, living, dining kitchen with separate servant quarters and other support facilities.

The muted vertical enclosure with accents of greys created a beautiful backdrop for colourful, vibrant furniture’s creating an accent.\n",
      "The outside was also broken in to smaller fragments with sensible use of different materials, yet cohesive and complimentary. A large sloping roof lined with shingles and wood finish HPL boards as soffits created a beautiful skyline, imparting the desired level of warmth making it visually balanced and appealing. Landscape softened the overall composition and helped in assimilating the building with its surroundings.\n",

The four bed residential unit with stilt + Upper three floors overlooking the park across the road, gave us the direction towards evolving this prototype. A larger opening s towards road, with the stepping back built form with interspersed terraces, formed a façade.

It is a home which gives a different meaning to life instilling a feeling of warmth and togetherness, creating essential pause in our fast paced life.\n",
      "The site was app.around 1800 sqft, the brief was to construct a 2 bed single dwelling unit in the ground floor, with the 3 bed room duplex home on top. The client wanted well lit and ventilated spaces, immaterial of surrounding development, without compromising the privacy. The site located on the intersection of three roads. Since privacy and silence was the key criteria, as a response we had left more setback front with step back terraces filled with landscape. The internal courtyard with the open plan ensured enough light in the upper floor.   As a response to the existing champaka tree canopy, we have protruded the last floor balcony, giving a feel of tree house when you are in that space.\n",

      "The genesis of this project starts with unique brief to build individual homes for four friends, with the unified identity. In their own words “design four homes within a large house”.\n",
      "The client approached us with the set of five plots each measuring 2400sqft, within a gated community located in the outskirts of Bengaluru. The sites were sandwiched between two parallel roads with independent access, slightly contoured with minimal vegetation. The plot in the centre hinging the other four plots had a beautiful well grown tree, around which the story of “Geleyara Goodu” unfolds, which literally translates to “ resting nest for friends”.\n",
      "As a response to the context, to negotiate site levels, independent garages are placed in the lower level, with part fill, the ground plane is modulated so as to have a high podium. The raised plinth eliminated a necessity for compound wall, also enhanced the visual appeal. The elevated datum ensures enough privacy with better visual connect to outside, along with holding all the built form together.\n",
      "Common parking flanked by a narrow guarded entry to the entire development reiterates the notion of “oneness”.  A non-ceremonial entry detached from road edge, modulated with the series of gradual steps, meandering through a dense landscape evokes a sense of suspense before landing on to the elevated common plaza.\n",
      "At a site plan level, the houses are layered around the central common green, which acts as a unifying element. Public spaces on the inner ring and private on the periphery gave us a flexibility to dematerialize the inner envelope with extensive use of glass, so as to establish the seamless connect with the landscape and with other adjacent units. The outer ring of private zone, relatively non porous with minimal fenestration making it lot more secure.\n",
      "As a unit, It’s a simple 2 bay plan with living, dining areas straddled across a private court overlooking a central green, kitchen, staircase  core  and guest bedroom in the other bay in ground floor. As on climbs on the first floor lands on to a vestibule, doubles up as informal study with bay window seating overlooking the central court,  leading on to two large bedrooms on either side with their own large open to sky private terraces.\n",
      "The interiors are kept minimal and simple using Kota and jaisalmer stone as flooring, balanced with exposed cement surfaces with wood as accent. The large wood finish UPVC windows along with cement plastered white walls and concrete under soffit constitutes the exterior facade. The landscape in the foreground blur the boundaries and softens the overall massing. Large over hanging roof works as shading element , enhancing the overall intent of dispersed habitable space under one large parasol, creating a “world within a world” , a cosy nest in a faraway tree.\n",

From the outset, the project posed significant hurdles, particularly with the timing, as we began just before the COVID-19 pandemic, and with the complex terrain, which necessitated numerous design revisions. Despite these obstacles, Vijay and Rajani stood by us unwaveringly, continually adapting the design while preserving the core vision.\n",
      "There were moments when, as the owners, we questioned whether the project could ever be completed. At times, we were on the brink of halting the work entirely. It was in those moments that Vijay, with his boundless confidence and unwavering support, encouraged us to move forward, even at a slower pace, and reminded us that giving up was simply not an option. Following his advice, we pressed on, and in the end, we successfully completed the project.\n",
