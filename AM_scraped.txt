Studio Recall
The site was a narrow corner plot, deep inset in the locality of Nagarabavi, dotted by huge trees. A trapezoidal plot measuring 6’ on one side and 22 ‘ on the other side with an elaborate brief to create a modern looking dental prosthetic clinic that needs to become a landmark by its architectural expression  was a real challenge.
The corner where the road meets was an acute angle, from where you had a long visibility and the huge tree canopies gave the initial impetus to the design development. The Edges where softened so that we reduce on the rigid vertical lines on the façade, so that the building appears to be bigger. The glazed façade on the road side ensured enough light and ventilation. At the upper levels extensive use of glass helped in establishing the connection with tree canopies giving a feel of tree house.
A low plinth with the seamless connection to the ground one enters on to reception and waiting lounge which is kept open, giving the feel of open pavilion. A toilet and vertical circulation core is placed on the narrow edge of the plot. In the first and second floor we have a large hall which has a dental chair, working desk along with the lounge seating and consultation areas. The large deck overlooks the surrounding green gives that additional expanse from inside out along with a nice layering to the façade from outside. The last floor accommodates the back of the house facilities including X-ray console, pantry and other areas
In terms of the materials, a monochromatic palette across the building was used, so that it looks cohesive without any fragmentation. The interior also has got a micro concrete floor matching the wall and ceiling with the accents of wood. A filleted corner, with arched openings and curved false ceiling makes the defining lines invisible makes the interior seamless.
Client Feedback
Dr Ritu
Transforming a small, skewed site into a luxurious, open space wasn’t easy, and we hadn’t imagined it could turn into something so beautiful. The way the outdoors seamlessly blends with the indoors brings out the true charm of our clinic. The lush greenery surrounding the space, combined with the thoughtfully designed landscape on each floor, makes it an absolute delight to experience.
Architect Vijay and Rajni always approached the project with openness, truly listening to our inputs. There was always space for fresh ideas to take shape, making the entire process dynamic and engaging. As aesthetic enthusiasts, my husband and I loved working with Avani Mudra’s team. We absolutely love the facade they designed, which ties everything together beautifully.

Outskirts of Bangalore within a gated community a corner plot overlooking a countryside vineyard, waking to a chirping sound of birds, sitting on a threshold of neither urban nor rural, with the good things of both the world ideal place for residence, a home for three generations to live together.
A 5 bedroom bungalow with an elaborate brief resulted in vertical stack up across 4 levels. The challenge was to articulate the mass, so that it doesn’t look like simple extrusion. The punctuation and layering is done in such a way that it will look lighter and visually appealing.
The ground floor houses car park gym, multipurpose room with back of the house facilities and a vertical circulation core connect to the upper level from where the actual house starts. One enters the first floor with the external steps detailed with lot of planter beds and water courts making the climb non perceivable. The large landscaped canopy opens on to a large formal living room through wide pivoted teak doors. The kitchen dining a large open hall with seamless blend separated by the shift is axis, without any separate screen or barrier.
The ground floor comprises of one guest room with attached toilet. A large court covered with mesh houses the tree and birds giving a feel of aviary. The dog-legged folded plate staircase winding across the court leads to two bedrooms and large family in second floor.  The staircase straddles to a different location from this level to skylight court. At this level two bedrooms with large deck space keeps the residents engaged with an outdoor gazebo, complete with a barbeque grill.
The external façade is cladded with Indian marble, balanced with micro -concrete finished solid surfaces. The landscape at multiple levels softens the rigid geometry and allows the eye to travel to the depth of site creating multiple layers there by creating a visual interest.

A charity project by nature a 500 seating capacity convention hall on the outskirts of south Bengaluru, had to be budget friendly, functional and shall have a minimal operational cost. The idea was to make it as affordable as possible to the common man.
The Plot was relatively flat, within a mango grove. The two level plan with lower level consisting of a large dining hall with wash room and toilet facilities. The Administrative office also in lower level from the point of accessibility. This kind of functional segregation helps in crowd management and also gives a flexibility of expanding the dining outwards with outdoor   party lawn.
The upper level accommodated a large banquet hall with huge stage and supporting accommodation block behind. The lobby in the front is kept intentionally large, so that small scale function can be hosted there itself.
A double height volume with the large over hanged roof accommodating the wide entry steps in a ground level, gives a sense of grandeur and scale. The large set in glass façade allows immense amount of diffused sunlight inside.
The landscape softens the entire mass by diffusing edges making the other geometry to stand out and unique.Howering HPL roof stands in contrast to Transparent glass facade punctuated with landscape pockets.

Set amidst beautiful rose garden within a plant nursery, spread in a sprawling expanse of 7 acres. It’s an office with 2 bed room duplex residence stacked up vertically. Crafted within a small footprint of 33 feetx22 feet this building comprises of office with manager cabin and customer lounge in the ground level and residence in the upper level. Privacy and visibility was a key criterion in terms of overall development.
A large blank wall cladded with marble with small opening marks the entry creating a sense of suspense, visually barricading what is behind. Once you pass this threshold an open pavilion with glass enclosure gives the glimpse of the entire property. The separate staircase leads to the upper level where the public domain of the house is placed. An open plan with living dining and kitchen is placed in this level, enhancing the sense of visual expanse with glazing on two longer side of the footprint, which overlooks on to the entire plant nursery. The other two blank faces hide the service area of the house.
The staircase core is strategically located in such a way that it becomes a private internal staircase of this duplex unit leading on the two separate ensuite bedroom which opens on to the large cantilever balconies opening to an outside vista completely disconnected from the lower public activities.
The building was supposed to induce the sense of opulence and mark its presence; we have used marble on the façade with wood and glass. The landscape and lighting compliments the overall façade to evoke the emotive qualities.

A beautiful east facing plot in a residential neighbourhood Bangalore started with the Unique brief. The client is from Coorg with his unmatched love for coffee and Golf, they wanted to build a 4 bedroom house, with a coffee shop and golf simulator room in the ground floor. The design was to deal with the challenge of segregating the privacy of the house from the coffee bar and simulator room which was public in nature.
The ground floor houses the coffee shop with the direct access from the road with golf simulator room as the part. The car parking, home office and servant quarters occupy the remaining portion of the ground floor footprint.
One approaches the house through a flight of stairs in first level, with the grand entry door leads on to a lobby. The linear dining and kitchen opens on to the screened sundeck on one side with water body and other landscape features.  The Metal screen helps on to maintain a private from the busy semi commercial neighbourhood. The living and bedroom is tucked behind so as to ensure the privacy and noise reduction.  A grand single flight staircase leads to the upper level where two bedrooms and home theatre is located overlooking the front court and rear double height space.
The last floor houses the guest bedroom and master suite which opens on to semi open gazebo and landscape terrace areas. A family space at this level which doubles up as a bar area, opens on to the terrace sideways overlooking the internal court on first floor.
As a brief client wanted to use corten steel as an element on the façade, we tried complementing that with brick and exposed concrete. The interspersed green spaces gel the mass together toning down the brutality of the mass & material, making it visually balanced.

The brief was to create home that is built on traditional principle which suits the present lifestyle, relevant and contextual.  A four floor 3 bedroom house shall have a scalabity, which should work as one bedroom lavish on regular basis, but should be able to accommodate the gathering of 50 people at a time.
The ground level consist of garage and back  of the house on the side with large lobby and circulation core , and a formal living opening on to rear landscape. An outdoor gazebo with landscape envelope with a small pantry works as a nice spill out giving a desired level of privacy.

Raga is the harmonious juxtaposition of cubes with interspersing built and open spaces. Sited within a well-known gated community of Bangalore, a corner plot located diagonally opp. community clubhouse. The exploration started as a response to its immediate context. At its inception, a basic cube as a design generator extrapolated in 2 bay 3 layered plans with two vertical stacks. The voids are created strategically subtracting modules as to allow light and ventilation and visual porosity.
The Ground consist of living, dining, kitchen and one guest bed room opening on to a common open to sky deck area covered with articulated metal screen on the vertical face so as to ensure privacy and security. In the Upper floor we have two large bedrooms with attached toilet and walk in dress, straddled across the common vestibule connected to lift and staircase.   The common area opens on to an external facing large outdoor deck which doubles up as a semi covered family outdoor lounge.
In terms of a façade it’s kept minimal with exposed concrete as hovering cube with large fenestrations with wooden screening. Black slate stone in random rubble masonry as base defining a datum further enhances a rigid geometry of concrete mass on top. The same random masonry has been used inside also as highlighter carrying the façade element inside.

Alora, Conceptualizes as a beautiful boutique, with customer centric, exclusive design store with the intention of holistic experience. Located in the first floor of the commercial building on the busy road of Bangalore, with exclusive client base, the interior has to exemplify the notion of luxury.
The fabric with its ability of free flow, continuity, was take as an inspiration with agile curved partition defining various zones of the store, with dressing room and stage for bridal dress mock ups. An elaborate zone for collection and photography with ability to post instantly on insta. Recording the sequence for future memory with an intention of giving a complete package, envisaged as pioneer in this kind, the architecture had to respond to that, with beautiful, modern and chick interiors.
The diagonally placed patterned tile juxtaposed with wooden floor at places, defining various zones. A seamless curved wall become a backdrop, as a display area and sometime enclosing spaces rendered the new dynamism to the space quality. The use of brushed gold PVD coated metal as brackets and hangers repeated itself in terms of furniture brought a sense of luxury. Arched display areas with plant themed wall paper with its dark green tones complimented well with the light beige colour ceiling.
The designer’s room with its informal client interaction area, a meeting room for collaborative discussion, a pantry for customer service where also detailed out in similar theme so that the experience was seamless. A large glass façade gave us a good visibility from the road along with ability to display designer wares making it presence felt, showcasing its purpose.   crambled

Our office is perched on the terrace of an existing three stories structure. The challenge was to carve out the office space from 1300 sqft of shared terrace space without disrupting the existing service or the usage. To get the required level of privacy and visual barrier, the axis of entry has been staggered with a set of low height baffle walls,  traversing a through a series of raised planter box with lush green landscape.
The L shape footprint covered with RC slab with open working office on one side and discussion room on other side. The hinge point of L accommodated the common pantry, printer, book storage spaces and common rest room. The external skin of “ L “ was mainly a solid mass punctuated by full height strip windows  which facilitated cross ventilation and inner portion was detailed with custom made collapsible metal frame finished with wood slats. This allowed the level of rain protection and security without compromising the visual aspect. The clean soffit of the roof with inverted beams acted as built in planter box with plants falling down creating a secondary skin of green foliage.
A cement wash on the wall and ceiling with similar colour tile made the entire composition uniform making it look like a single cast mould on a colour washed substructure. The wood brought the required level warmth complimented well with the landscape rendered a feel of rustic and aged feel.

“House of grey” is characterized by its monochromatic colour palette, where in our client insisted not to use natural wood finish or any accents. The only colourful things that will be there in the house are furniture & décor items carpets and landscape. Developing a Muted backdrop created a unique challenge of sourcing the material from dyed veneers to natural stones which are within the spectrum of visual palette that’s been approved.
3000 sqft plot located in one of the gated community, this home has a built up area of app. 7500 sqft comprising 5 bedroom / living, dining, kitchen, family and servant quarters along with other ancillary facilities. Ground floor as a datum finished with natural stone along with floating boxes dispersed above making the building interesting in terms of its composition. White micro concrete with concrete faux finish along with serrated black granite used as façade materials with appropriate indirect lighting.

Pavilion Home is located within private gated community. Large plot with wide road on three sides with lush green surrounding set the tone of this project. The idea was to create the built form along the road with the enclosed void within, where the entire house opens on to and also becomes the focal point. This was the need of a project for a couple who were   well-travelled, socially active with large friend circle.  The idea was to create an agile, private open space within a built form, which can be modulated and appropriated based on the occasion accommodating varied user group from a small group of friends to a large gathering.
The U prototype  single bay plan spread across two floors,  accommodating 4 bed rooms, living, dining kitchen with separate servant quarters and other support facilities. A high compound wall punctuated by large landscape pockets gives the sense of grandeur along with providing required privacy for the ground floor. One enter the building rom the corner of the longer side through a large wooden door with the parking and home office on one side and large double height living and dining on the other side. The public domains of the house are placed along the internal landscape, with long decks as transition zones. Large sliding glass windows enhance a visual permeability making the inside out transition seamless.
The kitchen utility and other service areas including servant quarters along with laundry and battery room are zoned towards the rear portion of the site with the separate service access makes it convenient to use it externally without compromising on the internal privacy. It also gives the flexibility to service staff to use these service areas independently whenever clients are not in station.
The Upper floor consists of three large ensuite bedrooms and large landscaped balconies along with the multipurpose hall which doubles up as a gyp, a reading nook. The Master bedroom opens on to private open to sky terrace overlooking the central green below.
The sense of luxury and comfort was a key criterion in terms of material selection. a large floor plate with Italian marble flooring interspersed with Indian teak  creating a right balance between modern yet contextual and rooted. The muted vertical enclosure with accents of greys created a beautiful backdrop for colourful, vibrant furniture’s creating an accent.
The outside was also broken in to smaller fragments with sensible use of different materials, yet cohesive and complimentary. A large sloping roof lined with shingles and wood finish HPL boards as soffits created a beautiful skyline, imparting the desired level of warmth making it visually balanced and appealing. Landscape softened the overall composition and helped in assimilating the building with its surroundings.
Client Feedback
Kurien Thomas and Swapna Thomas
An architect is professional who has often to satiate his client not only in building a dream but to cater to his/her ego, hidden prejudices or even educate. Avani Mudra has done this wonderfully as a husband wife team paying attention to detail, uncompromising on outcome, offering personal suggestions and dedicating a lot of personal time to our project. The attention, dedication & commitment to the project had surprised  both of us, so much so that we accepted them as part of our family. The results speak volumes, we now have a beautiful home we are proud of.

“Naandhi” It’s a new venture from Vainavi Homes. The Idea was to create home as a prototype reflecting affordable luxury, redefining the conventional planning typologies. The four bed residential unit with stilt + Upper three floors overlooking the park across the road, gave us the direction towards evolving this prototype. A larger opening s towards road, with the stepping back built form with interspersed terraces, formed a façade. The exposed brick with concrete façade, wooden roof under cladding brought in the required warmth.
A compact urban home has car parking with large lift and staircase lobby in the ground floor through which one enters the home. The first floor has living, dining and kitchen as a flexible, agile space, transient in nature with seamless assimilation.  The higher ceiling height gives a sense of grandeur and scale.
As one moves to the upper floors, the bedroom are placed on the either edge of bridge overlooking the lower floors. The last floor is receded back making way for large private terrace with the large multipurpose hall in the rear portion, scaling down the building height perception from road.

“Shriranga” A renovation project, where in client approached us for a quick facelift of the existing building. The building had two, three bedroom dwelling units stacked on above the other, with the common external staircase. The load bearing structure with its small compartments posed a real challenge in terms of overall design feasibility.
The entire plan opened up by demolishing all the non-essential walls, with temporary support to the slab. Slab was cut opened in strategic location to establish the internal vertical connection with the skylight above. Room bays has been reshuffled so as to make it vastu compliant and to get a larger workable room sizes. Internal staircase has been introduced by converting the exiting toilet bays.
The façade has been detailed with exposed concrete walls which was brutal, punctuated with terracotta jalis inside metal frame. The series of planters dispersed across the façade bringing in a right visual balance.

It is a home which gives a different meaning to life instilling a feeling of warmth and togetherness, creating essential pause in our fast paced life.
The site was app.around 1800 sqft, the brief was to construct a 2 bed single dwelling unit in the ground floor, with the 3 bed room duplex home on top. The client wanted well lit and ventilated spaces, immaterial of surrounding development, without compromising the privacy. The site located on the intersection of three roads. Since privacy and silence was the key criteria, as a response we had left more setback front with step back terraces filled with landscape. The internal courtyard with the open plan ensured enough light in the upper floor.   As a response to the existing champaka tree canopy, we have protruded the last floor balcony, giving a feel of tree house when you are in that space.
Use of natural material daylight and connected landscapes with unique modulation of spaces evoke sense of tranquillity and peace. For us home is like a parchment paper where each layer of colour leaves behind an impression with mélange of colours one above the other creating artwork which is a unique and personal with a story to tell. Viraam, indeed a place to pause in our day today, fast paced mundane life.

“Architecture is a visual art, and the buildings speak for themselves”  – Julia Morgan
A house with a private terrace, garden , huge windows , sunlight, paintings etc is what we dreamt when we were kids. While dreaming about a picture perfect house costs nothing, the tangible reality is something else.
A good architect can guide you to give shape to your dreams and make it a reality. Vijay and Rajani are passionate entrepreneurs who have embarked on a journey to create a unique mark for themselves in design and architecture.
After meeting few architects, we shortlisted Avanimudra design for our dream home project – VIRAAM.
From a detailed planning to meticulous execution, handholding and guiding us in the decision making process at every stage, Vijay and Rajani displayed high levels of professionalism and ethics throughout the journey. Several rounds of discussion and  probing to ensure every family member’s unique  requirements are incorporated in the design was a crucial aspect. This set the foundation and expectations were crystal clear from Day one.  They ensured to give us sufficient information and expert knowledge to help us in our decision making process .
Right from Building materials selection to  interior and décor, they shared their valuable inputs empowering us to take confident decisions. They dealt with our anxieties and excitement with calm and composure, thus leading to a joyful and stress free construction journey. Every day of the process was a new learning experience and Team AvaniMudra added value at every stage.  At the end of the journey Its very satisfying to be able to go through this process, turning a house into an extension of yourselves. We sincerely thank Vijay , Rajani and the team for their energy and enthusiasm in shaping our dreams and creating a masterpiece. We wish Team Avanimudra all the best for their future endeavours.

The genesis of this project starts with unique brief to build individual homes for four friends, with the unified identity. In their own words “design four homes within a large house”.
The client approached us with the set of five plots each measuring 2400sqft, within a gated community located in the outskirts of Bengaluru. The sites were sandwiched between two parallel roads with independent access, slightly contoured with minimal vegetation. The plot in the centre hinging the other four plots had a beautiful well grown tree, around which the story of “Geleyara Goodu” unfolds, which literally translates to “ resting nest for friends”.
As a response to the context, to negotiate site levels, independent garages are placed in the lower level, with part fill, the ground plane is modulated so as to have a high podium. The raised plinth eliminated a necessity for compound wall, also enhanced the visual appeal. The elevated datum ensures enough privacy with better visual connect to outside, along with holding all the built form together.
Common parking flanked by a narrow guarded entry to the entire development reiterates the notion of “oneness”.  A non-ceremonial entry detached from road edge, modulated with the series of gradual steps, meandering through a dense landscape evokes a sense of suspense before landing on to the elevated common plaza.
At a site plan level, the houses are layered around the central common green, which acts as a unifying element. Public spaces on the inner ring and private on the periphery gave us a flexibility to dematerialize the inner envelope with extensive use of glass, so as to establish the seamless connect with the landscape and with other adjacent units. The outer ring of private zone, relatively non porous with minimal fenestration making it lot more secure.
As a unit, It’s a simple 2 bay plan with living, dining areas straddled across a private court overlooking a central green, kitchen, staircase  core  and guest bedroom in the other bay in ground floor. As on climbs on the first floor lands on to a vestibule, doubles up as informal study with bay window seating overlooking the central court,  leading on to two large bedrooms on either side with their own large open to sky private terraces.
The interiors are kept minimal and simple using Kota and jaisalmer stone as flooring, balanced with exposed cement surfaces with wood as accent. The large wood finish UPVC windows along with cement plastered white walls and concrete under soffit constitutes the exterior facade. The landscape in the foreground blur the boundaries and softens the overall massing. Large over hanging roof works as shading element , enhancing the overall intent of dispersed habitable space under one large parasol, creating a “world within a world” , a cosy nest in a faraway tree.

Vijay and Rajani, the founders of Avanimudra, an esteemed architectural firm based in Bangalore, have become much more than just professionals to us—they are an inseparable part of our family and synonymous with the realization of our dream project,
Geleyara Goodu
. From our very first meeting, they shared our passion for the project, matching our excitement and vision. They fully immersed themselves in bringing to life our dream of a home where nature plays a central and harmonious role.
The journey was not without its challenges. From the outset, the project posed significant hurdles, particularly with the timing, as we began just before the COVID-19 pandemic, and with the complex terrain, which necessitated numerous design revisions. Despite these obstacles, Vijay and Rajani stood by us unwaveringly, continually adapting the design while preserving the core vision.
There were moments when, as the owners, we questioned whether the project could ever be completed. At times, we were on the brink of halting the work entirely. It was in those moments that Vijay, with his boundless confidence and unwavering support, encouraged us to move forward, even at a slower pace, and reminded us that giving up was simply not an option. Following his advice, we pressed on, and in the end, we successfully completed the project.
Words cannot fully express our gratitude for Vijay and Rajani. Their unwavering dedication, meticulous attention to detail, and the highest standards of professional integrity have been invaluable to us. We are incredibly fortunate to have had them as our design partners, and we stand by the decision to work with them every step of the way.
The entire
Geleyara Goodu
team extends our heartfelt wishes to Vijay and Rajani for continued success in all their future endeavors.

“Sambhrama” It’s a place intended for celebration of life. We had to design a 5 bed room house with the provision for office space in the ground floor. The site was app.1200 sqft and the brief was the house needs to look bigger and spacious. The client was very particular that the house shall not be a stack up of floors, but has to have a visual connect across all floors from within.
As a response to brief, the half split floor plates, straddled across the open to sky court, gave a flexibility to give a large opening internally without compromising of privacy. The first series of flight connecting living to dining & Kitchen is articulated as informal seating acting as an extension of living room.
Each level accommodates one bed room with attached toilet and dress culminating in a family space which doubles as a bar opens on to large landscaped terrace. The façade is kept minimal, dappled by necessary deep set punctuation of openings finished with white marble grit plaster. As a response to the openings of building across we have detailed aluminium slats screening so as to maintain a visual privacy.
